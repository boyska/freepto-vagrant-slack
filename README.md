This simple vagrant box is just a minimal debian with
[freepto-slack](https://github.com/avana-bbs/freepto-slack) as provisioner.

It will quickly get the user ready to build debian packages and build
[freepto](https://github.com/avana-bbs/freepto-lb)

## Quickstart

Most useful commands are in `/usr/local/*bin/`, so watch there.

## Building packages

If you want to build packages, you need to enable the `pbuilder` slack role.
